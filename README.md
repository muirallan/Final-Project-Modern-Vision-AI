# Final-Project-Modern-Vision-AI

Abstract 
This report outlines a system for the automated identification of UDC (University of the District of Columbia) student members of a royal court using YOLOv8 for object detection and ChatGPT for contextual reasoning. The system leverages YOLOv8â€™s real-time detection capabilities to recognize royal court-specific attire, accessories, and context (e.g., ballons, backpacks, crowns, robes, scepters). At the same time, ChatGPT interprets this data to confirm membership status and determine if the individuals are students. This project finds applications in educational institutions, ceremonial events, and automated attendee analysis systems.
